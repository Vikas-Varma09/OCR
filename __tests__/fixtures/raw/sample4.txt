This may deter some purchasers and affect marketability. This is reflected in the mortgage\r\n valuation.\r\n There is pedestrian access only at the property.\r\n It is assumed that appropriate rights of way and management arrangements are in existence for the\r\n shared pedestrian access. Legal advisors to confirm.\r\n There is evidence of structural movement in the form of cracking to masonry and distortion\r\n to/around lintels. This appears to be longstanding but may deter some purchasers and affect\r\n marketability. This has been considered in the mortgage valuation.\r\n There was no loft access.\r\n The property's EPC rating is D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n IMPORTANT NOTICE TO THE APPLICANT:\r\n 1.
