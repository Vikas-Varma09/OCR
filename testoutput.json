Our valuation\r\n assumes that these are reasonable.\r\n The property is in an area of past mining activity. The valuation assumes that the property is not\r\n adversely affected.\r\n Tests have identified some properties in the area as having such levels of radon gas in excess of\r\n limits considered acceptable. Further advice on this can be obtained from National Health England.\r\n There was no loft access.\r\n The property's EPC rating is C.\r\n The building has cladding and/or balconies but further information has not been requested about\r\n whether remediation works may be required because it falls outside RICS advice current at the time\r\n of this valuation. However, this decision is not a guarantee that works will not be required in\r\n future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n IMPORTANT NOTICE TO THE APPLICANT:\r\n 1.
